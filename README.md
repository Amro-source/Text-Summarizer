# Text-Summarizer
Python


There are different ways to build a software architecture for a Python text summarizer application. One way is to use an abstractive text summarization method that uses a deep learning model such as OpenAIâ€™s GPT-3 to generate summaries that are not necessarily exact sentences from the original text1. Another way is to use an extractive text summarization method that identifies significant sentences from the original text and adds them to the summary2. You can also use existing Python packages such as spaCy, Gensim, or The Text API that provide text summarization functionalities3
