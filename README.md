# Text-Summarizer
Python


There are different ways to build a software architecture for a Python text summarizer application. One way is to use an abstractive text summarization method that uses a deep learning model such as OpenAIâ€™s GPT-3 to generate summaries that are not necessarily exact sentences from the original text1. Another way is to use an extractive text summarization method that identifies significant sentences from the original text and adds them to the summary2. You can also use existing Python packages such as spaCy, Gensim, or The Text API that provide text summarization functionalities3


A text summarizer application using extractive algorithm is a program that can create a short summary of a given text by selecting the most important sentences or phrases from the original document. The extractive algorithm does not generate any new words or sentences, but only extracts existing ones based on some criteria such as relevance, importance, or similarity. Some examples of extractive text summarization techniques are TextRank1, ROUGE2, and TF-IDF3.
